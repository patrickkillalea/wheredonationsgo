This site was built with help from one of my friends who works in Concern. We were concerned that the charity scandals of recent years were taking its toll on donations in Ireland and wanted to do something to counteract it.
We decided to create a website which rates all Irish charities and compares them against each other by using fancy visualizations.
We take the information that charities publish in their annual reports and standardise it. This means you can see what your favourite charity is doing with your donation. And you can compare it with other charities.
